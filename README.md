# About
this project aims to be a tutorial for FastApi

we have decided to learn two API frameworks, FastAPI and Django

we have also chose to work with sync api provide and async api provider

for sync we have choose Django

for async we have choose FastAPI

althought FastApi is a sync api 

but also FastApi is the most easier framework to use so because of all of these we have decided to use FastApi
